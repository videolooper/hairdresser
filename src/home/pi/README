This image is a video looper meant for exhibits and other continuous video use.
The scripts run automatically on startup to fullscreen and have a minimal delay in between videos.

To stop the playback run the following command:
sudo /etc/init.d/videoloop stop

To start the playback run the following command:
sudo /etc/init.d/videoloop start

To see if the playback is running, run the following command:
sudo /etc/init.d/videoloop startus

To add new videos, stop the service, then add the file to the videos folder in /home/pi/videos/
Then restart the service.
To delete videos, do the same.

SSH is enabled with a username of pi and a password of raspberry. This should be changed for security purposes.
